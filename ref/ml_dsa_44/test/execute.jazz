/* The correctness of the transformations applied by Jasmin when compiling code
 * relies on the input code not having undefined behaviour. Running our implementation
 * through the interpreter is a sanity-check: If we run the interpreter without
 * crashing the program, at least for the inputs we've given it in "runner.jazz",
 * the program is correct.
 *
 * Ideally, we'd want to run the implementation through a safety-checker, but this
 * checker is outdated and takes an inordinate amount of time to run (on the order
 * of several days).
